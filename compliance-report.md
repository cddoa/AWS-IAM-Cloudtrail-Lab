# AWS Cloud Environment Compliance Assessment

## Executive Summary
The AWS lab environment in this project is designed to test how industry-standard governance and compliance frameworks can be integrated with cloud-native security services. 
The lab simulates a secure enterprise environment by implementing IAM with least-privilege and MFA enforcement, CloudTrail and CloudWatch for audit logging and monitoring, GuardDuty for continuous threat detection, and Lambda for automated incident response.
The purpose of this assessment is to measure the labâ€™s alignment with ISO 27001:2022 Annex A security controls to identify strengths and highlight areas for improvement.
